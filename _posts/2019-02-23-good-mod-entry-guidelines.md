# Good Mod Entry Guidelines

> Keep in mind this is under heavy modification as time goes by. Any content of this is not final.

Sayonika thinks that all mods should exact a certain quality, just like any other game mod out in the internet.

To this extent, we want to promote fair, qualty, and exceptional content on every entry in the Mod DB.

## The Guidelines

We ratified this guidelines to let you know what we think qualifies as a good mod. In essence, it needs to be non-discriminative, creative, and unique in nature.

### Mods should be unique

Mods that are unique by all aspects (storywriting, art, idea, to name a few), and does not borrow from existing entries, with the exception of dating sims (like Monika After Story).

These entries must be in essence, qualify as standalone in nature, and can share at least few references from other entities.

### Mods should be creative

We believe when you are making a mod, you have the full control of how will the characters live their lives everyday. We encourage people to make a mod that doesn't feel too long and bland.

We don't want people abondoning your mod just from the title itself. To share a few insights from a few people:

- *"A good mod tells a story well. Takes you along. Treats you well or poorly, but in a manner you appreciate when its over." -Mattyd#8358*
- *"it needs to have a significant amount of new content. i dislike mods that are 75% act 1 and 25% new content" -Zudo (DDMM)*

With some of these in mind, we can deduce that your mod should fit well within on the parameters of good story flow. If you can't avoid your mod to be long, that's not bad! As long as content merges well and you artistically meshed them like a light novel, you have something people can read.

### Mods should not attack anyone, or discriminate any party

We believe DDLC Mods are in nature, free from political speech, and free from being used as a instrument for harassment and bullying.

However, this does not mean to limit your expression of free speech, rather, to express that mods are in nature a game and games are a form of "art" you can use to express. However, DDLC is not the medium to express political concerns, nor be used as a instrument for intentional targeting.

Satires is alright, but a mod designed only to harass person X is not.

## Conclusion

With these guidelines in stone, we want to encourage everyone to follow these examples. Anyone can make a mod, but like any other form of art, it still has its limits and quirks.

These guidelines are not meant to restrict you, rather, to show you what we expect from *your* mod by the time you click "submit" on the submission form.
